# "Zero to Hero Fitness" Game Design Document

## Core Concept
"Zero to Hero Fitness" is a browser-based fitness game inspired by the "One Punch Man" workout regimen. The game helps users progressively build up to completing 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats, and a 10km run through gamified exercise tracking and boss battles.

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Exercise Tracking System
- **Pushups**: Generates "Strike Power" (1 point per rep)
- **Situps**: Generates "Core Power" (1 point per rep)
- **Squats**: Generates "Force Power" (1 point per rep)
- **Running**: Generates "Endurance Power" (10 points per km)
- Perfect form (to be measured via device sensors in mobile version) gives 1.5x multiplier

### 2. Power System
- Power points accumulate daily
- Power slightly decays if workouts are skipped
- Power is used in boss battles
- Different exercise types generate different power types

### 3. Progression System
- **Initial Assessment**: Users complete baseline test to determine starting point
- **Progressive Training Plans**: Gradually increasing daily targets
- **Tier System**:
  - Tier 1 (25%): 25 pushups, 25 situps, 25 squats, 2.5km run
  - Tier 2 (50%): 50 pushups, 50 situps, 50 squats, 5km run
  - Tier 3 (75%): 75 pushups, 75 situps, 75 squats, 7.5km run
  - Final Tier (100%): 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats, 10km run

### 4. Boss Battle System
- Battles occur after completing daily workout
- Users "spend" power points on different attack types:
  - Quick Strikes: Low power, high frequency
  - Power Moves: High power, requires charged meter
  - Special Techniques: Unlocked at specific milestones
- Bosses have health bars and weakness patterns
- Strategic element: Choosing right attack type for each boss

### 5. Milestone Rewards
- **Tier 1 Zone**: Basic hero costume upgrade, "Novice Hero" title
- **Tier 2 Zone**: Advanced hero abilities, "Rising Hero" title
- **Tier 3 Zone**: Legendary hero equipment, "Elite Hero" title
- **Final Zone**: "One Punch Hero" ultimate title, golden hero costume

## Future Features (Mobile Version)

### 1. Raid System
- Available after reaching Tier 2
- Weekly raid bosses with massive health pools
- Friend system to join raid parties (up to 5 members)
- Team roles based on exercise focus

### 2. Guild System
- Create or join training guilds with shared goals
- Guild headquarters that upgrade with collective progress
- Guild challenges for bonus rewards
- Inter-guild competitions

### 3. Seasonal Content
- Monthly mega-boss challenges
- Seasonal themed workouts
- Limited-time training zones
- Global collaborative challenges

## User Experience Flow
1. **Onboarding**: Initial assessment → fitness level determination → personalized starting point
2. **Daily Routine**: Open app → today's workout displayed → guided workout session → boss battle → completion celebration
3. **Progress Review**: Weekly summaries showing improvement → adjustments to plan if needed

## Technical Implementation Considerations
- Exercise validation (manual input for browser version, sensor-based for mobile)
- User data storage and progression tracking
- Visual representation of character growth
- Battle animation system
- Responsive design for various devices
